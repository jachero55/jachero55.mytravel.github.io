# jacherowebdev.photography.github.io
Hello, this project is about photography. I created this website for my uncle who is a photographer based in St. George, Utah. This is a front-end part, I have used Html, Css and Javascript

# I have used this command to watch sass: sass --watch src/sass/_main.scss:src/css/main.css
To have sass compile to css, I created a css folder and a main.css file, then created sass folder and a -main.scss file. and then ran this command: sass --watch src/sass/_main.scss:src/css/main.css to compile sass to css. Both of these folders I created them in the src folder.
# To watch for sass, the command is ran inside the root folder
